# -Molecular-dynamics-Interaction-plot
Two scripts for MD interaction analysis (similar to interaction fraction on desmond).
How to use:
1. Set your pdb_file_name and ligand_code on the "run_interact.sh".
2. Run "run_interact.sh" where your pdb file is located.
3. Run "run_interact.sh" in the same directory.
